# Frontend (public/)

Browser-facing portion of the Blocks World simulator. The dashboard UI now serves as the canonical reference for layoutâ€”other pages (admin, auth, debug) reuse the same design tokens, typography, and component patterns.

---

## Pages

- `index.html` â€“ main simulator dashboard (planner controls, saved worlds, stats, timeline)
- `admin.html` â€“ admin panel shell using the same responsive sidebar & profile menu
- `profile.html` – authenticated account overview with editable credentials
- `login.html` / `signup.html` â€“ compact auth cards with shared message styling
- `debug.html` â€“ lightweight developer utilities for manual API checks

Each page depends on the generated Tailwind bundle (`assets/app.css`) and the runtime modules in `utils/`.

## Modules of Note (`public/utils/`)

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `main.js` | Boots the dashboard, wiring world state, handlers, and persistence |
| `ui-handlers.js` | Simulation controller (planner requests, animation sequence, save/load) |
| `persistence.js` | Saves worlds with stacks, colours, and intention timelines |
| `timeline.js` | Renders and restores the intention timeline + planner clock |
| `stats.js` | Tracks steps/time/status during simulation runs |
| `auth.js` | Login/signup helpers, JWT storage, admin guard |
| `navigation.js` | Mobile menu & collapsible sidebar |
| `profile.js` | Shared profile button/menu logic |
| `helpers.js` | Message helpers, checksum utility, etc. |

---

## Styling

- Tailwind utilities onlyâ€”no bespoke stylesheet beyond the generated bundle.
- Source file: `tailwind.css`; output written to `assets/app.css`.
- Common tokens live in `tailwind.config.js` (brand palette, shadows, typography).
- Run `npm run build:css` for a one-off build or `npm run watch:css` for live updates.

Cards, alerts, and timeline entries share class maps defined in the modules (`helpers.js`, `timeline.js`), so adjust there when tweaking colours/states.

## Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies at the repo root: `npm install`
2. Tailwind:
   ```bash
   npm run watch:css   # rebuild on change
   # or
   npm run build:css   # production build
   ```
3. Run the backend (Docker or manual) so API endpoints are available.
4. Open `public/index.html` in a browser (or serve via the Express static middleware when running the backend).

The simulator writes planner results, world timelines, and UI stats to the browser; the backend persists the same data for reloads. Keep the saved-world schema (`models/World.js`) and `persistence.js` in sync when evolving the UI.
